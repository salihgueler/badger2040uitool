# Badger2040 UI Design Tool - Development Notes

This document contains development notes and implementation details for the Badger2040 UI Design Tool.

## Overview

The Badger2040 UI Design Tool is a web-based application that allows users to design interfaces for the Badger2040 e-ink display (296x128 pixels). The tool provides several features including canvas drawing tools, image handling, profile generator, company badge generator, and Python code generation.

## Implementation Details

### Canvas Drawing Tools

The drawing tools are implemented using HTML5 Canvas API. The main features include:

- Freehand drawing with adjustable line thickness
- Line, rectangle, and circle shape tools
- Text insertion with configurable font size
- Black and white color options (1-bit display)
- Undo/redo functionality using a stack-based approach

### Image Handling

Image handling is implemented using the FileReader API and Canvas manipulation:

- Images are loaded using FileReader
- Automatic resizing is done using canvas context's drawImage method
- Conversion to 1-bit (black and white) format is achieved using threshold-based pixel manipulation
- Center positioning is calculated based on image and canvas dimensions

### Profile Generator

The profile generator creates professional profile badges with:

- QR code generation using the qrcode-generator library
- Proper QR code rendering that matches the Badger2040 SDK implementation
- Text fields for name, company, title, and social media handle
- Dividing line positioned at x=130 to separate QR code and text

### Company Badge Generator

The badge generator creates company badges based on the official Badger2040 badge example:

- Company name at the top with black background and white text
- Employee name prominently displayed in the center with automatic scaling
- Title and email fields at the bottom
- Company logo upload and display on the right side
- Proper image handling with aspect ratio preservation

### Python Code Generation

The code generator creates Python code compatible with the Badger2040 SDK:

- Proper initialization and display setup
- Drawing commands that match the created design
- Button handling and power management code
- Support for QR codes, text, and images
- Error handling for missing resources

## Development Process

This tool was developed with assistance from Amazon Q CLI. The development process involved:

1. Setting up the basic HTML/CSS/JS structure
2. Implementing the canvas drawing functionality
3. Adding image handling capabilities
4. Creating the profile and badge generators
5. Implementing Python code generation
6. Testing and refining the user interface
7. Ensuring compatibility with the Badger2040 SDK

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

- Adding more drawing tools and shapes
- Supporting additional badge and profile templates
- Implementing a save/load feature for designs
- Adding a preview mode that simulates the e-ink display
- Supporting additional Badger2040 features like button mapping
